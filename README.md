# Traffic Violation Data Analysis  


## Project Overview  
This exploratory data analysis project looks at trends, patterns, and insights related to traffic enforcement. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization of key findings and some statistical analysis.  



## Dataset  
- **File Link:** [Traffic Violations.csv](https://github.com/gokul2178/Traffic-Violations-Python-EDA/blob/main/Traffic_Violations.csv)
- **Source:** [catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations)  
- **Description:** The dataset contains records of traffic violations such as location, time and violation types 


## Analysis

- **Notebook Link:** [Traffic Violations.ipynb](https://github.com/gokul2178/Traffic-Violations-Python-EDA/blob/main/Traffic_Violations.ipynb)
- **Overview**: The dataset was first explored to understand the structure then cleaning processes like removing duplicate columns and unnecessary columns. The EDA reveals trends based on location, time , ect supported by visualizations like bar chars, histograms and heatmaps. There is also some use of statistical analysis to identify violation frequency.
